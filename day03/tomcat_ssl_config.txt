1. Purchase SSL certificate or for testing create one self-signed certificate using "keytool" command.
	
	keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA
	
	It creates ".keystore" file in your home (/home/username) directory.
	

2. Copy .keystore file into tomcat directory with name "keystore".

3. Into tomcat/conf/server.xml:
	- Comment port 8080 settings.
	- Uncomment port 8443 settings.
		Also add "keystore" path and keystore password.

4. Testing:
